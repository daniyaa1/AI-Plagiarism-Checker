#  AI Plagiarism Checker

This is a simple web app I created using **Streamlit** and **GPT-2** (from Hugging Face) to check whether a piece of text is likely written by a human or generated by AI.

It uses two main things:
- **Perplexity** – tells how predictable the text is
- **Burstiness** – checks how repetitive the structure is

I also added some cool visuals and made the interface a little more engaging using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript inside Streamlit.

## 🔹 What It Does

- You enter any text into the app
- It analyzes the structure of the text using GPT-2
- It shows:
  - **Perplexity Score**
  - **Burstiness Score**
  - A guess: “Human-Written” or “AI-Generated”
- It also shows the top 10 repeated words in a chart

##  Tech Used

- Python + Streamlit (for the web app)
- Hugging Face Transformers (GPT-2 model)
- Torch (for model backend)
- NLTK (for text processing)
- Plotly (for bar chart visuals)
- Some extra HTML, CSS, and JS for a nicer UI
